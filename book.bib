	abstract = {Level of Traffic Stress ({LTS}) metrics are widely used to examine how bicyclists may perceive stress along urban streets and identify opportunities for infrastructure improvements. The intuitiveness of the original method, which condensed 18 input variables into four levels, has made {LTS} very popular among practitioners. Nonetheless, it can be challenging to collect all required inputs. In response, numerous alternative methods have been developed with fewer or different inputs drawn from more general sources, such as {OpenStreetMap} ({OSM}) or {GIS} datasets from local agencies. These methods tend to use the same four-level schema, suggesting that they are commensurate, though this may be an inappropriate assumption. We examine agreement between seven {LTS} methods calculated from three data sources throughout two major U.S. cities and find substantial differences between many outcomes. Interestingly, the simplest {LTS} method and the least precise dataset, {OSM}, provided the most consistent outcomes. This suggests using simpler albeit less precise approaches to improve commensurability between {LTS} analyses. For more detailed analyses, we recommend site studies with on-the-ground measurements rather than relying on {LTS} to characterize subtleties. We also encourage clear labeling of {LTS} methods and data sources to avoid confusion about how results can be interpreted and compared.},
