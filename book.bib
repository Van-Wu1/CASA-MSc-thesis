	abstract = {Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) metrics are widely used to examine how bicyclists may perceive stress along urban streets and identify opportunities for infrastructure improvements. The intuitiveness of the original method, which condensed 18 input variables into four levels, has made LTS very popular among practitioners. Nonetheless, it can be challenging to collect all required inputs. In response, numerous alternative methods have been developed with fewer or different inputs drawn from more general sources, such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) or GIS datasets from local agencies. These methods tend to use the same four-level schema, suggesting that they are commensurate, though this may be an inappropriate assumption. We examine agreement between seven LTS methods calculated from three data sources throughout two major U.S. cities and find substantial differences between many outcomes. Interestingly, the simplest LTS method and the least precise dataset, OSM, provided the most consistent outcomes. This suggests using simpler albeit less precise approaches to improve commensurability between LTS analyses. For more detailed analyses, we recommend site studies with on-the-ground measurements rather than relying on LTS to characterize subtleties. We also encourage clear labeling of LTS methods and data sources to avoid confusion about how results can be interpreted and compared.},

We use shortest-path analysis to identify all street-level connections between all rail and underground stations in inner London. We are able to identify the critical pathways which show a long tail distribution and a radial/cellular spatial pattern. We visually compare this network with the existing cycling network and explore two scenarios of street interventions in 8 critical pathways using streetspace cross-section analysis. The methods presented here can offer valuable analytical capacity for developing new cycling and walking schemes and designing place-based streets that are more appropriate to control virus propagation.},

	abstract = {The lack of cycling infrastructure is a major deterrent to cycling for transportation in the U.S., yet planners and engineers may lack the tools to assess and communicate the potential network impacts of proposed cycling infrastructure. Without these tools, cycling infrastructure may be built ad hoc or where it is politically convenient, instead of where it would be most effective at improving mobility, accessibility, and the actual and perceived safety of cycling. To address these problems, this research outlines a framework for assessing new and existing infrastructure through BikewaySim. BikewaySim is an open-source shortest path model that uses link impedance functions to account for cyclists' preferences for link attributes (e.g., presence of a bike lane, flat terrain, traffic volumes, traffic speeds) and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the least impedance path between any origin-destination pair. To demonstrate the framework, the shortest path is found between 28,392 potential origin-destination pairs for a small study area in Atlanta, GA to assess the impacts of two infrastructure projects. Two impedance functions are demonstrated. The first is based on travel time, while the second uses travel time and example attribute impedances. From the solved shortest paths, percent detour, change in impedance, and link betweenness centrality are calculated, and bikesheds, selected routes, and link betweenness centrality are visualized. Results demonstrate that BikewaySim can effectively visualize potential network improvements from cycling infrastructure and has additional applications for trip planning. Future research will focus on calibrating link impedance functions with GPS trace data showing revealed preferences and surveyed response data on user preferences for cycling infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Developing safe and efficient cycling networks is a vital part of creating more bike-friendly and, thus, more sustainable communities. To promote cycling effectively, continuously improving and expanding the cycling network is important. Yet, understanding and measuring the impact of newly developed cycling infrastructure is not always a straightforward task, which is often performed using limited-scope surveys or simulations. The present study aims to present a data-driven method for estimating the impact of recently developed links in the cycling network by utilizing public bicycle sharing (PBS) data. The case of Tartu, Estonia, is examined using PBS data from three consecutive years to measure pre-post change in the utilization of street segments with newly built cycling infrastructure. Bicycle-sharing trips that make use of one of these segments are extracted, and various metrics are calculated and compared. Additionally, novel metrics for measuring the impact of new developments in cycling network are presented. Specific examples of significant shifts in route choice are detected and visualized. The results indicate that the share of PBS trips that employ any of the newly improved street segments has increased compared to the pre-construction period. This study demonstrates how public bicycle sharing data can be effectively used to assess the impact of infrastructure on cyclists' route choice, and presents specific findings in the case of Tartu.},
