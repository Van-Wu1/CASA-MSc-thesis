Understanding the relationship between urban cycling accessibility and infrastructure quality has been a prominent focus in spatial and transport research over the past decade. Numerous studies have emphasized the role of dedicated cycle lanes, traffic-calmed streets, and connected networks in promoting bicycle usage in cities (Pucher & Buehler, 2008; Hull & Oâ€™Holleran, 2014).

The concept of Low-Stress Network (LTS) classification proposed by Mekuria et al. (2012) has been widely adopted as a framework to assess the comfort and safety of cycling environments. It categorizes street segments based on traffic speed, volume, and intersection complexity, providing a scalable metric for infrastructure evaluation. Recent works (Conveyal, 2020; Broach, 2021) further operationalize LTS methods using OpenStreetMap and GTFS data, enabling large-scale, reproducible analyses.

Environmental perceptions also significantly influence cycling behaviour. Studies have shown that air quality (de Nazelle et al., 2011), green view index (Zhang et al., 2022), and even soundscape (Aletta et al., 2019) can affect the attractiveness of cycling routes. Integrating such perceptual dimensions into infrastructure analysis has become a growing trend, leading to the development of composite indicators like the Cycling Environment Comfort Index (CECI), which attempt to synthesize structural and perceptual factors into a unified framework.

However, there remain several gaps in the literature. First, most accessibility-based studies focus on either spatial network topology or perceived comfort but rarely combine both systematically. Second, few empirical studies have validated LTS-based classifications using real-world cycling behaviour data, such as GPS trajectories or app-based route choices. Third, while multi-criteria indicators like CECI are gaining popularity, their construction methods vary greatly across studies, lacking consensus on factor weighting or standardization.

This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing a hybrid evaluation framework that integrates network-level accessibility measures with environmental perception indices. The review above forms the conceptual basis for this integration, drawing from methodological insights and empirical findings in existing research.

Harvey et al. (2024) systematically compared seven LTS classification methods across different data sources and found considerable variation, questioning the assumption of commensurability [@harvey_comparing_2024].
